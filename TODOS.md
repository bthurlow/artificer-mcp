# Artificer TODOs

Deferred work with enough context that someone picking it up in 3 months knows what to do. Not a task tracker — a place to capture "we decided to not do this now, and here's why."

---

## 1. Evaluation harness generalization

**What:** Generalize `scripts/fal-bakeoff.mjs` (talking-head-specific today) into a reusable capability-agnostic harness.

**Why:** Today's script runs three candidate video models against a fixed avatar + audio fixture, produces a markdown summary, and scores against a talking-head-specific rubric. The pattern is reusable. Every time a new capability's bake-off is needed (image portrait vs landscape, music vs SFX, TTS vs ASR), we'd re-author ~300 lines of near-identical script.

**Pros:**
- Each new bake-off becomes a config file + run command, not a script-rewrite.
- Cross-capability rubrics (lip-sync accuracy, character consistency) can be reused.
- Output format stabilizes into something `/qa` and downstream tools can consume.

**Cons:**
- Abstraction tax up front. Script is small enough that rewriting takes ~1h; generalizing takes longer.
- Abstraction risk: over-generalizing before the second use case reveals what's actually variable.

**Context:**
- Current script location: `scripts/fal-bakeoff.mjs` (landed 2026-04-23 in commit 7beac7f).
- Shape: submit N models in parallel to fal's queue API, poll, download outputs, write summary markdown.
- Rubric today is talking-head-specific (lip-sync, character consistency, tail silence preservation). Any generalization needs to make rubrics pluggable.
- Design doc explicitly lists this as OUT of scope: `docs/plans/fal-multi-provider-design-2026-04-23.md` → "EXPLICITLY OUT" → "General-purpose evaluation harness. Today's `scripts/fal-bakeoff.mjs` is the MVP. Generalizing into a reusable capability-agnostic harness is a separate plan, not blocked by this one."

**Trigger to pick this up:** First time a non-talking-head bake-off is needed. Probably the cinematic-video class-2 bake-off (see Phase 4 trigger in the design doc).

**Depends on / blocked by:** Nothing. Can land independently of the multi-provider Phase 1-5 work.

## 2. Automated fal spec drift detection

**What:** Add a scheduled CI job (weekly cron) that runs `scripts/sync-fal-specs.mjs` and opens a PR if any spec has changed.

**Why:** The hybrid spec integration (OpenAPI + llms.txt fetched and committed at build time) means spec drift is visible in PR diff — but only when a contributor re-runs the sync script. If fal silently updates a model's schema (adds a param, changes a default, adjusts pricing), we won't notice until someone happens to run sync. A periodic auto-sync + auto-PR catches it without manual action.

**Pros:**
- Schema drift surfaces automatically, not when a user hits a bug.
- Pricing changes appear in PR review (important for cost budgeting).
- Zero ongoing cost — runs once a week in CI.

**Cons:**
- Requires the sync script to be stable first (can't auto-PR noise while we're still tuning the ingest).
- Auto-PRs can be ignored; drift accumulates until someone reviews.
- Adds a CI credential requirement (FAL_KEY available to the cron job) if the script needs auth.

**Context:**
- Depends on the `scripts/sync-fal-specs.mjs` script landing as part of Phase 1 (see `docs/plans/fal-multi-provider-design-2026-04-23.md` → Phase 1 updated scope).
- Suggested implementation: GitHub Actions workflow on cron, runs sync, commits changes to a branch, opens PR with changed spec files + diff summary.
- Naming convention: PRs titled `chore: sync fal-ai specs ({date})`.

**Trigger to pick this up:** After sync script has been running manually for a month or two and the diffs are stable / non-noisy.

**Depends on / blocked by:** `scripts/sync-fal-specs.mjs` shipping in Phase 1.

## 3. Cost observability / structured logging for generation tools

**What:** Each `fal_generate_video` (and later `fal_generate_image`, etc.) call emits a structured log event capturing: model, duration/resolution/image/audio dimensions, elapsed wall time, estimated cost based on the catalog, request_id, success/failure.

**Why:** The downstream pipeline produces many clips per piece. Real-world questions: "how much did we spend on reels this week?", "is Wan or Kling cheaper per finished second in practice?", "which model has the highest failure rate on our inputs?". None of these are answerable today — callers would have to wrap every tool call themselves.

**Pros:**
- Enables spend tracking across the pipeline without each caller building its own logging.
- Catalog's `cost` strings become the source of truth for cost estimates (already derived from llms.txt).
- Failure-rate observability comes for free.

**Cons:**
- Logging surface needs a policy: where do logs go? stdout? a file? a sink the caller configures?
- Adds weight to the tools. The design's "thin transport" stance partially conflicts — logging is not routing, but it IS an opinion.
- Cost estimation is approximate (720p vs 1080p tiered, etc.) — log says "estimated $0.70" but actual bill could differ.

**Context:**
- Design doc today has tools return `{uri: output}` and that's it. No logging surface defined.
- If built: probably a `ToolLogger` interface injected via the MCP server's init, with a no-op default. Avoids forcing a logging library choice.
- Structured event shape suggestion: `{tool, model, input_summary, elapsed_ms, estimated_cost_usd, status, request_id}` as JSONL.

**Trigger to pick this up:** First time someone asks "how much are we spending on media gen?" or "why did that batch take so long?" and nobody can answer.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Phase 1 `fal_generate_video` shipping first (so there's something to log).
